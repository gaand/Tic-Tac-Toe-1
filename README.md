# Nick Wilcox tic tac toe

I created a tic tac toe game that allows the user to sign up, log in, log out, change
password, and see a display of games played, in addition to playing tic tac toe.

User story --
the user first signs up for a profile, then signs in.  A game starts. The user
plays tic-tac-toe. They can then sign out or change their password if they so desire.

This game was made with html, css, a small contribution from bootstrap, javascript, jquery, and ajax from communication with
the api.
